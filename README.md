This is a low voltage ATtiny13-based voltmeter. I wanted to have one more measurement tool, and since I don't need high precision at all, this project was a good idea. Also i can read it in the dark, whoo!

Funny thing is that until then I thought breadboards are not so bad when it comes to noise and stuff. However, when this circuit was assembled on a breadboard, ADC readings jumped like crazy (by something like 5% in both directions), and stuffing the board with shitload of caps didn't help at all. Now, when soldered, everything is stable.
